Hello, thanks for considering our paper. I hope it is within scope.

**Suggested Reviewers**
From the [Five most similar historical JOSS papers](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/9375#issuecomment-3499478509), the top two papers are the best fit. In my opinion, the most important thing is knowledge of GEE and climate is secondary. Here's who I suggest:
* arbennett
* usethedata
* martibosch
* kmarkert
* aazuspan

This recently published [paper](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/8164) is also relevant but the reviewers are not in the database.
