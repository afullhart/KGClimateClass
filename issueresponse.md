Hello, thanks for considering our paper. I hope it is acceptable for review.


From the [Five most similar historical JOSS papers](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/9375#issuecomment-3499478509), the top two are the best fit. In my opinion, the most important thing is knowledge of GEE. Here's who I suggest:
* arbennett
* usethedata
* martibosch
* kmarkert
* aazuspan

Blah
