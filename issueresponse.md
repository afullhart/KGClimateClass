Hello, thanks for considering our paper. I hope it is within scope.

**Suggested Reviewers**

From the [Five most similar historical JOSS papers](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/9375#issuecomment-3499478509), the top two papers are the best fit. In my opinion, the most important thing is knowledge of GEE and climate is secondary. Here's the suggested reviewer list:
* arbennett, usethedata, martibosch, kmarkert, aazuspan

This recently published GEE-related [paper](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/8164) is also relevant but the reviewers are not in the database.

**Submission Checklist**

[x] OSI-approved license
[x] Installation instructions
* The GitHub Repo has a section called Setup that provides instructions for installation and importing the developed package.

[x] Documentation exists at all
* The GitHub Repo has documentation for the developed package under [Usage Notes](https://github.com/ARS-SWRC/GEE-KGCC/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#usage-notes). Because the package has relatively few functions, there is room for this documentation.

[x] Tests of some sort
* The [Test Example](https://github.com/ARS-SWRC/GEE-KGCC/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#test-example) is a python notebook that may be used for testing. In this case, because manual GEE authentication steps are already necessary in order to import the package, we opted to make the the entire test a manual test.
